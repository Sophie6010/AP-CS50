sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: I know because it sorts from highest to lowest.  It also is the fastest, besides merge sort, at sorting a sorted array.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: I know because it was the fastest sort for a random array.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: I know because it was the slowest at sorting the already sorted arrays.  It has to find the lowest values first, which takes a long time because the array is reversed.
